**TitanPocketKeyboard** is an Android input method that entirely relies on the embedded keyboard of the Unihertz Titan Pocket and provides most features expected on a full-sized keyboard.

This is a fork from https://github.com/oin/titanpocketkeyboard and is heavily customized to work with Vietnamese.

# Installation

1. Download the latest APK from the [releases](https://github.com/oin/TitanPocketKeyboard/releases) page.
2. Install the APK on your Unihertz Titan Pocket.
3. Go to `Settings` > `System` > `Languages & input` > `Virtual keyboard` > `Manage keyboards` and enable `TitanPocketKeyboard`.

# Features

- Full keyboard layout with all keys and symbols.
- No space taken on the screen.
- Long press for alternate characters (see list below).
- Multiple key presses (in quick succession) for accented characters, and other alternate symbols (see list below).
- Keyboard navigation, simulating arrow keys and home/end/page up/page down keys, using the `sym` modifier.
- Lock modifier keys by double-tapping them, while a single tap will only have effect for the next key press.
- See modifier key state in the status bar.
- Auto-capitalization of the first letter of a sentence.
- Two spaces after a period automatically replaced by a period and a space.

# Keyboard layout

The keyboard layout is based on the QWERTY layout of the Unihertz Titan Pocket, extended to allow access to most characters and symbols expected on a full-sized keyboard.

## Accented characters

You can select a template that specifies the characters that can be accessed by multiple key presses in quick succession (_multipress_).
There is an option to disable the multipress feature for consonants.

## `sym` modifier map

Using the `sym` modifier, you can access more keys and symbols.
For instance, you can use `WASD` or `HJKL` to navigate in text.

The Cut/Copy/Paste actions are only available when no modifier is pressed.

# Customizing and contributing

Feel free to adjust the layout to your needs by modifying the code and building your own version. If you think your changes could be useful to others, please consider contributing them back to this project or making a public fork.
